# Installing

## Introduction

This example shows how to generate a `make install` target to install files and
binaries on your system. This is based on the previous shared library example.

The files in this tutorial are below:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── cmake-examples.conf
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── installing
│       └── Hello.h
├── README.adoc
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

  * CMakeLists.txt - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
  * cmake-examples.conf - An example configuration file
  * include/installing/Hello.h - The header file to include
  * src/Hello.cpp - A source file to compile
  * src/main.cpp - The source file with main

## Concepts

### Installing

CMake offers the ability to add a `make install` target to allow a user to
install binaries, libraries and other files. The base install location is controlled
by the variable +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+ which can be set using ccmake or by calling
cmake with `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/location`

The files that are installed are controlled by the https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/install.html[+install()+] function.

```cmake
install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst_bin
    DESTINATION bin)
```



Install the binary generated from the target cmake_examples_inst_bin target to
the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin+

```cmake
install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib)
```



Install the shared library generated from the target cmake_examples_inst target to
the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib+



> NOTE
>
> This may not work on windows. On platforms that have DLL targets you
> may need to add the following
>
> ```cmake
> install (TARGETS cmake_examples_inst
>     LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
>     RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)
> ```
>
> 

```cmake
install(DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/
    DESTINATION include)
```

Install the header files for developing against the +cmake_examples_inst+ library
into the +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include+ directory.

```cmake
install (FILES cmake-examples.conf
    DESTINATION etc)
```

Install a configuration file to the destination +${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc+

After `make install` has been run, CMake generates an install_manifest.txt file
which includes details on all installed files.

> NOTE
>
> If you run the `make install` command as root, the install_manifest.txt file will be owned by root.

## Building the Example

```bash
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ cmake ..

$ make

$ sudo make install

$ cat install_manifest.txt
/usr/local/bin/cmake_examples_inst_bin
/usr/local/lib/libcmake_examples_inst.so
/usr/local/etc/cmake-examples.conf

$ ls /usr/local/bin/
cmake_examples_inst_bin

$ ls /usr/local/lib
libcmake_examples_inst.so

$ ls /usr/local/etc/
cmake-examples.conf

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib cmake_examples_inst_bin
Hello Install!
```

> NOTE
>
> If `/usr/local/lib` is not in your library path you may need to add it to the path before running the binary.

### Extra Notes

#### Overriding the default install location

As mentioned the default install location is set from the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, which defaults to `/usr/local/`

If you want to change this default location for all users you can add the following code to your top level CMakeLists.txt before adding any binaries or libraries.

```
if( CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT )
  message(STATUS "Setting default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path to ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/install")
  set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/install" CACHE STRING "The path to use for make install" FORCE)
endif()
```

This example sets the default install location to under your build directory.

#### DESTDIR

If you wish to stage your install to confirm that all files are included the `make install` target supports the DESTDIR argument.

```
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/stage
```

This will create the install path `${DESTDIR}/${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` for all your installation files. In this example, it would install all files under the path `/tmp/stage/usr/local`

```
$ tree /tmp/stage
/tmp/stage
└── usr
    └── local
        ├── bin
        │   └── cmake_examples_inst_bin
        ├── etc
        │   └── cmake-examples.conf
        └── lib
            └── libcmake_examples_inst.so
```

#### Uninstall

By default CMake does not add a `make uninstall` target. For details on how to generate an uninstall target see this [FAQ](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Can_I_do_.22make_uninstall.22_with_CMake.3F)

For an easy way to remove the files from this example, you can use:

```bash
sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```
