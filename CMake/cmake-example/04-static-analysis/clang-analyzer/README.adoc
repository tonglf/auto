# clang-analyzer

## Introduction

This example shows how to call the [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) to do static analysis using the scan-build tool.

The files included in this example are:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── subproject1
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main1.cpp
└── subproject2
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── main2.cpp
```

- [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/04-static-analysis/clang-analyzer/CMakeLists.txt) - Top level CMakeLists.txt
- [subproject1/CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/04-static-analysis/clang-analyzer/subproject1/CMakeLists.txt) - CMake commands for subproject 1
- [subproject1/main.cpp](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/04-static-analysis/clang-analyzer/subproject1/main.cpp) - source for a subproject with no errors
- [subproject2/CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/04-static-analysis/clang-analyzer/subproject2/CMakeLists.txt) - CMake commands for subproject 2
- [subproject2/main2.cpp](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/04-static-analysis/clang-analyzer/subproject2/main2.cpp) - source for a subproject that includes errors

## Requirements

To run this example you must have clang analyzer and the scan-build tool installed. This can be installed on Ubuntu using the following command.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install clang-3.6
```

It will result in the tool being available as:

```bash
$ scan-build-3.6
```

## Concepts

### scan-build

To run clang static analyzer you can use the tool `scan-build` to run the analyzer when you also run the compiler. This overrides the CC and CXX environment variables and replaces them with it’s own tools. To run it you can do

```bash
$ scan-build-3.6 cmake ..
$ scan-build-3.6 make
```

By default this will run the standard compiler for your platform, i.e. `gcc` on linux. However, if you want to override this you can change the command to:

```bash
$ scan-build-3.6 --use-cc=clang-3.6 --use-c++=clang++-3.6 -o ./scanbuildout/ make
```

### scan-build output

scan-build will only output warnings during compile time and will also generate a list of HTML files which contain detailed analysis of the error.

```bash
$ cd scanbuildout/
$ tree
.
└── 2017-07-03-213514-3653-1
    ├── index.html
    ├── report-42eba1.html
    ├── scanview.css
    └── sorttable.js

1 directory, 4 files
```

By default these are output to /tmp/scanbuildout/{run folder}. You can change this using `scan-build -o /output/folder`.

## Building the example

```bash
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ scan-build-3.6 -o ./scanbuildout cmake ..

$ scan-build-3.6 -o ./scanbuildout make
