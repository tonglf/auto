# Unit Testing

## Introduction

单元测试是一个软件开发过程中应用程序的最小可测试部分，单元被单独和独立地检查是否正常运行。这可能涉及获取一个类、函数或算法，并编写可以运行的测试用例，以验证单元是否正常工作。

CMake includes a tool called [CTest](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest) which allows you to enable the `make test` target to run automated tests such as unit tests.

There are many unit-testing frameworks available which can be used to help automate and ease the development of unit tests. In these examples I show how to use some of these frameworks and call them using the CMake testing utility CTest.

The examples here include using the following frameworks:

- [Boost Unit Test Framework](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide.html)
- [Google Test - Download](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
