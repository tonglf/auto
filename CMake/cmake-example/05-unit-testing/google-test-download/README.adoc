# Google Test Unit Testing Framework

## Introduction

Using [CTest](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest) you can generate a `make test` target to run automated unit-tests. This example shows how to download and build the [google test](https://github.com/google/googletest) library, create tests and run them.

The files in this tutorial are below:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── 3rd_party
│   └── google-test
│       ├── CMakeLists.txt
│       └── CMakeLists.txt.in
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── Reverse.h
├── Reverse.cpp
├── Palindrome.h
├── Palindrome.cpp
├── unit_tests.cpp
```

- 3rd_party/google-test/CMakeLists.txt - CMake commands to build and prepare the google test library
- 3rd_party/google-test/CMakeLists.txt.in - Helper script to do the download of google test
- CMakeLists.txt - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
- Reverse.h / .cpp - Class to reverse a string
- Palindrome.h / .cpp - Class to test if a string is a palindrome
- unit_test.cpp - Unit Tests using google test unit test framework

## Requirements

An internet connection. This example will download the google test library the first time you run the CMake configure step. See the [google test readme](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md) and [here](http://crascit.com/2015/07/25/cmake-gtest/) for details.

## Concepts

### Download and Build Google Test

```cmake
add_subdirectory(3rd_party/google-test)
```

This will add the CMake files which download and build Google Test. This is the recommended way to add google test and there are more details from [google test readme](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md) and [here](http://crascit.com/2015/07/25/cmake-gtest/)

Alternatives to this method include:

- Use something like `git submodule` to download the source to a folder in your tree and then do `add_subdirectory`
- Vendor the google test source code within your repository
- Build google test externally and link it using `find_package(GTest)` - Not recommended by the google test authors anymore

### Enabling testing

To enable testing you must include the following line in your top level CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
enable_testing()
```

This will enable testing for the current folder and all folders below it.

### Adding a testing executable

The requirement for this step will depend on your unit-test framework. In the example of google test, you can create binary(s) which includes all the unit tests that you want to run.

```cmake
add_executable(unit_tests unit_tests.cpp)

target_link_libraries(unit_tests
    example_google_test
    GTest::GTest
    GTest::main
)
```

In the above code, a unit test binary is added, which links against the google test unit-test-framework using the ALIAS target setup during the [download and build](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/05-unit-testing/google-test-download/3rd_party/google-test/CMakeLists.txt) of GTest.

### Add A test

To add a test you call the [`add_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_test.html) function. This will create a named test which will run the supplied command.

```cmake
add_test(test_all unit_tests)
```

In this example, we create a test called `test_all` which will run the executable created by the `unit_tests` executable created from the call to `add_executable`

## Building the Example

```bash
$ mkdir build

$ cd build/

$ cmake ..

$ make

$ make test
Running tests...
Test project /data/code/cmake-examples/05-unit-testing/google-test-download/build
    Start 1: test_all
1/1 Test #1: test_all .........................   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.00 sec
```

If the code is changed and it causes the unit tests to produce an error. Then when running the tests you will see the following output.

```bash
$ make test
Running tests...
Test project /data/code/cmake-examples/05-unit-testing/google-test-download/build
    Start 1: test_all
1/1 Test #1: test_all .........................***Failed    0.00 sec

0% tests passed, 1 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.00 sec

The following tests FAILED:
    1 - test_all (Failed)
Errors while running CTest
Makefile:72: recipe for target 'test' failed
make: *** [test] Error 8
```
